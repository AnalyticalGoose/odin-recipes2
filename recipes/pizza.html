                <li>Cornmeal or semolina flour for dusting</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>828ml can crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>30-60ml olive oil</li>
                <li>4g sugar</li>
                <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Cheese</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>680-910g whole-milk, low-moisture mozzarella, freshly grated</li>
                <li>Grated parmesan for dusting</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the water, sugar & yeast in a large bowl and let it sit for a few
                minutes. It should bubble a little if the yeast is alive. 
            </li>
            <li>Add the olive oil and 600g of bread flour. Mix until just combined and start 
                kneading.</li>
            <li>Knead until you can stretch some of the dough into a thin sheet without tearing.
                Add flour as needed until you can reach this point.
            </li>
            <li>Divide the dough into four equal balls and put them in four glass containers.
                Lightly coat the balls and the interior of the containers with olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>Cover and rise at room temperature for two hours or in the fridge for 1-7 days</li>
            <li>For the sauce, simply mix together the ingredients</li>
            <li>To cook, preheat your oven to the maximum it will go. Liberally dust a pizza peel 
                with cornmeal or something similar. Stretch the dough onto the peel and top with
                just enough sauce to coat the surface. Dust the sauce layer with parmsan and then cover
                with mozzarella. Bake until the crust is well-browned, 6-7 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
